## Introduction

### Notes from initial meeting {.tohide}

- We want to implement a simple toy model
  - we want demography, e.g. age, for individuals
  - we want to have some categorisation for the context ndoes (bipartite nature is probably important)
  - we need a process with non-markovian waiting time
  - want a competing process

### Why this is unique/interesting {.tohide}

- The simulation of epidemics has been instrumental in defining policy at various levels, from healthcare unit to government. 
- Much success can be had with models that approximate individual behaviours using approaches like mass-action.
- However, the individual interaction can be important in periods where the assumptions of the approximations cannot hold.
- To structure the interactions between individuals, there are many approaches [missing info], but a standard model is to use a network, or graph, to define the possible interactions between individuals.
- To realistically represent modes of interaction in a memory-efficient manner, we choose to use bipartite networks, where, as usual, individuals are represented as nodes, in one of the disjoint sets; and the contexts of interaction are now also explicitly nodes, and are the other disjoint set; i.e. individuals are connected to other individuals through interaction context nodes. 

### Problem Setup/Motivation {.tohide}

- The formation of this method was done to do simulation of government policies to control COVID-19 in New Zealand over 2020-2022.
- That model worked with a large, multi-layered, bipartite network that was derived from multiple sources of government-level data.
- Different data sources informed different layers of the bipartite network, that represent different contexts of infection
- This bipartite network is large, with over X million nodes, and created with [data sources]
- We wanted to construct relatively complex agent-like logic, without explicitly looping over each agent, especially when they are not important to the infectious disease process.


- Here we will present on a simple model with some important mechanisms included.

### Algorithm and principles

<!--this is placeholder until I put an actual algorithm in, I just need to make sure algorithms render-->

We write an algorithm in pseudocode in @alg-quicksort.

```pseudocode
#| label: alg-quicksort
#| html-indent-size: "1.2em"
#| html-comment-delimiter: "//"
#| html-line-number: true
#| html-line-number-punc: ":"
#| html-no-end: false
#| pdf-placement: "htb!"
#| pdf-line-number: true

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Quicksort}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{Quicksort}{$A, p, r$}
  \If{$p < r$}
    \State $q = $ \Call{Partition}{$A, p, r$}
    \State \Call{Quicksort}{$A, p, q - 1$}
    \State \Call{Quicksort}{$A, q + 1, r$}
  \EndIf
\EndProcedure
\Procedure{Partition}{$A, p, r$}
  \State $x = A[r]$
  \State $i = p - 1$
  \For{$j = p$ \textbf{to} $r - 1$}
    \If{$A[j] < x$}
      \State $i = i + 1$
      \State exchange
      $A[i]$ with     $A[j]$
    \EndIf
    \State exchange $A[i]$ with $A[r]$
  \EndFor
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

## Results

Here, we show 

```{python}
#| echo: false

from networkcontagion.lib import simulation
```

```{python plot}
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 4], [3, 6, 5])
```
